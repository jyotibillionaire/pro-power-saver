                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="single_part">
                        <h4>It is no secret that the price of electricity is steadily increasing each year. Still, thanks to this new Nikola-Tesla-inspired technology, consumers can save hundreds to thousands of dollars every year on their electric bills.</h4>

                        <p>Just this year, a new study suggested that most Americans are overpaying for electricity by a whopping 35.4 billion dollars per year.</p>
                        <p>We as Americans have an energy crisis—a lack of energy from lawmakers and the Public Utility Commission about fixing the crooked business of selling overpriced electricity to consumers.</p>

                        <div class="preview_image">
                            <img src="../landing-html/ecowatt-pro/images/Electricity_GraphFinal.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" />
                        </div>

                        <p>Both sides are giving each other cover to do nothing. Just this year, the Public Utility Commission sent lawmakers a report about the glorious, incredible, fantastic electricity shopping system it regulates. A problem? Not on their
                            watch.</p>
                        <p>Lawmakers who get that report from the state regulators can say, <i>"Everything is fine. We don't need to make changes."</i> Lawmakers refuse to introduce an electricity bill that is designed to end the deceptive marketing practices
                            that power companies use to reap massive profits every year.</p>
                        <p>The system remains a horror show of confusion, duplicity, and unnecessary complications. There's no reason why electricity companies should get the better of regulators and consumers, but they do it repeatedly.</p>
                        <p>If you look at descriptions of more than 300 electricity plans from 55 companies, you see a jumble of garbage language, terms, conditions, and small print—your eyes bulge. And you won't learn your exact price until the bill arrives.</p>
                        <p>Why does this matter? This duplicity leads to you paying more.</p>
                        <p>Electricity companies also confuse shoppers with tiered pricing—different rates for different usage levels—but they ensure that the lowest prices show up early in search results.</p>
                        <p>So, to cut a long story short, Big Energy is running a massive racket, and as long as they are not regulated, they'll continue to get away with it.</p>

                        <h4>But the war isn't lost for the ordinary consumer. Thankfully, clever new technology can help average consumers reduce their electric bills by up to 90% month after month!</h4>

                        <p>A German-based startup company has come up with a new innovative and inexpensive gadget that helps you not only lower your electric bill but can also increase the lifespan of expensive household appliances. Within just one month,
                            the device would pay for itself.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="single_part">
                        <div class="heading">
                            <h2>What is This Device?</h2>
                        </div>

                        <p>Pro Power Save and its tech were created by no other than the legendary Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist David Ristovski.</p>
                        <p>Initially, he concealed it from the general public because it offered average families the opportunity to save on their monthly energy costs. Pro Power Saveis a small, compact, affordable, and easy-to-use plug-in unit that stops unnecessary
                            power from entering the electrical cables and overloading the network.</p>
                        <p>Pro Power Save is your power company's worst nightmare. So they have been trying to hide Pro Power Save from the everyday consumer and have even banned it in retail shops.</p>
                        <p>Big Energy is threatened by this device and its potential to cut into profits.</p>
                        <p>However, thanks to the Internet, the secret is out, and everyday people are now reaping the rewards of less power consumption overall and household appliances.</p>

                        <div class="preview_image">
                            <img src="../landing-html/ecowatt-pro/images/benefits.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" />
                        </div>

                        <p>The bonus? Your standard blender, microwave, vacuum, or any other household appliance may last longer.</p>
                        <p>In essence, Pro Power Save provides the opportunity for you to save up to 90% on your energy bill. That's phenomenal savings and makes it easy to understand why Big Energy wants this device hidden from consumers for good.</p>
                        <p>The benefits of Pro Power Save are unparalleled, and researchers are convinced this device could spell the end of unaffordable power bills that can cripple the average wage-earner at the end of the month.</p>
                        <p>Scientists initially spent many months trying to debunk efficacy claims, but those studies now prove that Pro Power Save should be commonplace in every household.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="single_part">

                            <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
                        </div>

                        <div class="preview_image">
                            <img src="../landing-html/ecowatt-pro/images/How_It_Works.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" />
                        </div>

                        <p>It's easy to connect. Plug into the outlet closest to your breaker box. That's all you need to do. Once plugged in, the green LED indicates it is powered on and working.</p>
                        <p>If your home is large, it is beneficial to place 1 unit close to the breaker box and another as far away from it as possible. It is as simple as that. And it's suitable for both standard homes and apartments connected to an electrical
                            grid.</p>
                        <p>Once you've plugged it in, Pro Power Save will get to work. Within a few days, it will begin to make efficient use of your energy while allowing you to reap the rewards of a more robust household appliance lifecycle. In just a short
                            time, you will have made your money back on your initial purchase.</p>
                        <p>Appliances always draw more power than they need to run due to inefficiencies and noise on the sine wave.</p>
                        <p>Pro Power Save reduces this noise, therefore decreases the amount of electricity wasted. It does not change what the meter reads or steal extra power from anywhere, and it just uses the energy more efficiently, therefor needing less
                            of it.</p>
